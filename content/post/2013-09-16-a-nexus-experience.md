Yup, Google is going to release, probably, a new phone, and I&#8217;va bought a Nexus 4 (discounted); why?

Because my HTC Sensation is gone, destroyed, I&#8217;ve killed the crap out of it bringing it to the most difficult Ingress operations around London.  
I am not buying a new phone because I wanto to play Ingress, I am buying a new phoine because I was playing Ingress, damn&#8230;  
The new battery and the battery pack helped a little bit, but at the end, it was unable to keep GPS and date on without touching 100 degrees Celsius, or keeping a phone call going for more than 5 minutes without rebooting.

Let&#8217;s see if this one will behave a little bit better.
