Last Thursday I&#8217;ve lived for 4-6 hours into Ingress, going around with few Pro-Players.  
4 thoughs in my mind since then

1) I am damn too old for those things  
2) I don&#8217;t giva a damn if I am too old it&#8217;s still fun  
3) I am a NooB, need practice  
4) I am a little bit scared about my future social life

Few things needed to take part at this useless and meaningless war (as all the wars are)  
&#8211; A new Android Smart Phone (bought JUST BECAUSE my old \*Dumb Phone\* died): <a href="http://blog.polemicover.net/?attachment_id=928" target="_blank">HTC Sensation</a>  
&#8211; One new powerful battery: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Anker-1900mAh-Battery-Sensation-Mytouch/dp/B0053EZJMC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1367322424&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=sensation+battery" target="_blank">Anker 1900mAh Li-ion Battery</a>  
&#8211; One portable battery pack capable of 6 full charges: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/PowerGen-PGMPP12000-12000mAh-sensation-Thunderbolt/dp/B0085OB0IE/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1367322518&#038;sr=8-13&#038;keywords=battery+pack" target="_blank">PowerGen PGMPP12000</a>
