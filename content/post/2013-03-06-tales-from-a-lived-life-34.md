Fault tolerant, maledizione, be always fault tolerant.  
There&#8217;s nothing worst than hunting down who sent you an SMS for your birthday (today) from an unknown UK number, without signing it, and not responding back to your not very but enough explicit &#8220;who the hell are you?&#8221;.

Anyway, thanks to everyone; Happy New Year To Me!

So Long,  
and thanks for all the fun
